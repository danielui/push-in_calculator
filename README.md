**Project description**

"Push-in_calculator" is the script designed for help mechanical engineers to calculate press fit connections between shaft and the hub. It's a useful tool that allows to save a lot of time in the work of an engineer. I'm using it by my own. About this type of mechanical connection  you can read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_fit. 
In a nutshell, this application doing tedious mechanical calculation instead of engineer. The user also no longer needs to look at the geometric deviation tables. All these arrays are gathered in one excel file and being processed using "openpyxl" library

**Run the Project**

1. Install Openpyxl library `pip install Openpyxl`
2. Clone repository and run main.py.
